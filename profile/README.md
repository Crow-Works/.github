# Welcome to Crow-Works

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Greetings, and thanks for stopping by our humble digital lair!

If you're here hunting for our Engine, here's the deal: it's still in active development and remains closed-source until further notice. We're knee-deep in code, squashing bugs, and generally kicking ass to bring you something truly sick. So, sit tight and check back laterâ€”we promise it'll be worth the wait.

## What We're Up To
- **Raven Engine:** Our pride and joy in the making, built with C++20 and Vulkan. We're not just building an engine; we're crafting a powerhouse that's as efficient as it is robust.
- **Hardcore Development:** We work on the bleeding edge of tech, and yes, sometimes that means getting our hands dirty with some serious shit.
- **Community & Collaboration:** We love to share our journey, even if it's just bits and pieces. Stay tuned for updates, behind-the-scenes peeks, and the occasional rant about pesky bugs.

## Why Closed-Source?
The Engine is a passion project under heavy development, and keeping it under wraps helps us fine-tune and secure our work. Weâ€™re not quite ready to show the world our secret sauce, but trust usâ€”itâ€™s cooking up something epic.
